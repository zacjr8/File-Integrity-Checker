# File-Integrity-Checker

This script calculates checksums for all files in the specified directory and stores them in a file named checksums.txt. Upon subsequent runs, it compares the current checksums with the previously stored ones to detect any changes in file content. If changes are detected, it outputs the filenames of the modified files. Otherwise, it confirms that the file integrity check passed without any changes.
